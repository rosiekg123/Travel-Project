<h3> Why Rhodes?</h3>
<h2>The island of vivid contrasts</h2>
<p>
  Rhodes has a long and impressive history; it’s a place where the strong mediaeval aspect blends with the traditional Greek one. It is also an island with great natural beauty: the lovely beaches face the pine woods on the mountainsides; the mountain villages overlook the seaside towns; and  the archaeological sites, the mediaeval monuments and the cosmopolitan resorts arranged in the traditional style all conspire to make the popularity of this destination so hard to resist, even to a demanding traveller.
</p>
<p>
  This Mediterranean gem of an island boasts a centuries-old history: a turbulent past full of unexpected turns and twists of fate. It flourished during the 4th c. BC; this is when the famous Colossus of Rhodes, a gigantic statue sculpted by Charis from Lindos, Rhodes, who was a student of Lysippos, a master sculptor at the time. The history of this island is a rich one, as each conqueror left their strong mark on it.

<h2 class="card-title"> Lindos Town</h2>
<p>Lindos is considered by many visitors to be the most remarkable archaeological site on Rhodes. As one drives south towards the village from the island's north, the breathtaking natural scenery of the area with the Lindos Acropolis perched on a massive rock, the white village houses, and the crystal-clear blue waters captivates the senses and often compels one to make a complete stop. The panoramic view from this vantage point is simply awe-inspiring and an experience not to be missed. </p>

<h5> What I like about it</h5>
<p>
  It is a beautiful traditional Greek town with historical interest. You can climb up through the winding town streets and buy traditional crafts or souvenirs and then climb up to the acropolis above the city. Here you can see historical ruins and a beautiful view over the bay below.

<h2 class="card-title"> Prasonisi</h2>
<p> A beautiful beach located at the southernmost tip of the island. Here you can see where the Agean and the Mediterranean Seas meet. An amazing place to swim or take part in water sports such as surfing and windsurfing. There are amenities such as a cafe, beach loungers and showers and plenty of parking.</p>

<h5> What I like about it</h5>
<p>
  It is a beautiful beach and it is really interesting to watch the two different seas meeting as one is smooth and calm and the other rougher. The sea is warm to swim in and the facilities are useful.

<h2 class="card-title"> Rhodes Old Town</h2>
<p> In the Medieval - Old - Town of Rhodes one may for sure enjoy one of the most interesting walks on the island. Do not let the "medieval" mislead you: rather than a ruined, deserted setting, you will be pleasantly surprised to wander through an intricate network of busy little commercial streets delightfully alternating with quiet alleys, in what is a very much alive town consistently dwelt in over the last two thousand years!  No wonder, therefore, that for some time now, the Medieval Quarter of Rhodes - the oldest inhabited medieval town in Europe - forms part of the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage network!</p>

  Another beautiful traditional Greek town with lots of places to shop and cafés and restuarants with traditional Greek food and drink. A bustling town packed with history. </p>
